# NcycloAPI
Easy-to-use socket-based Application-2-Application Java Library 


This is the 2.4.0 build of Ncyclo, it still includes the Exclusion code. This is here in case you rely on it, otherwise, use 2.5.0.

This version will not be updated, but it might be restored if I find a way to implement Exclusions better.
