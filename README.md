# NcycloAPI
API-2-API Communication Middle-Man Java Library


This is the 2.4.0 build of Ncyclo, it still includes the Exclusion code. This is here in case you rely on it, otherwise, use 2.5.0.

This version will not be updated, but it might be restored if I find a way to implement Exclusions better.
